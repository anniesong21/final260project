# Abstract
## Introduction
The final project investigated changes in the virulence of the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic. As a secondary analysis, the project examined whether excess mortality during the pandemic could be explained by COVID-19 mortality. We used publicly-available data from the CDC and the US Census. We conducted the analysis for the 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. 
## Methods
For virulence, we divided the pandemic into seven waves and compared total case, hospitalization, and mortality rates to identify periods of high and low virulence. For excess mortality, we predicted expected mortality using a linear model of all-cause mortality from 2014-2019 by state and week. We compared the difference in actual vs expected mortality to recorded COVID-19 deaths. 
## Results
We found that virulence peaked during September 2020-February 2021 before decreasing. We found that deaths due to COVID-19 do not entirely explain the difference in actual vs predicted mortality.
## Discussion
Our analysis showed that COVID-19 virulence peaked during September 2020-February 2021 before decreasing, potentially related to viral evolution and public health adaptations by state. We also found that COVID-19 deaths do not represent the entirety of excess mortality, suggesting that the pandemic may have caused indirect deaths through other mechanisms.
